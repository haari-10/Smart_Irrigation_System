# 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an automated smart irrigation system that monitors soil moisture levels in real time and controls a water pump accordingly. The system helps reduce water wastage and ensures optimal watering of plants using sensor-based automation.

An Arduino microcontroller reads data from a soil moisture sensor and activates a relay-controlled water pump when the soil becomes dry. This project demonstrates the practical application of Embedded Systems and IoT concepts in agriculture.

# 🎯 Objectives

To automate irrigation using soil moisture sensing.

To minimize water wastage through intelligent control.

To reduce manual intervention in plant watering.

To demonstrate Arduino-based real-time monitoring.

# 🧩 Components Used

Hardware:

Arduino UNO

Soil Moisture Sensor

Relay Module

Mini Water Pump

Jumper Wires

Breadboard

Power Supply

Software:

Arduino IDE

Embedded C (Arduino language)

# ⚙️ Working Principle

The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture level in the soil.

Arduino reads the analog sensor value and converts it into a moisture percentage.

If the moisture level falls below a defined threshold, the relay module is activated.

The relay switches ON the water pump to irrigate the soil.

When sufficient moisture is reached, the pump is turned OFF automatically.

Sensor readings and pump status are displayed on the Serial Monitor.
